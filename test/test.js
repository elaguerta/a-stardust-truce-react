// import assert, a Node module useful for testing
const assert = require('assert');

// Write all tests using the 4 phase approach: setup, exercise, verify, teardown.
// 1. Setup: create objects, variables, and set conditions that the test depends on
// 2. Exercise: execute the functionality you're testing
// 3. Verify: check your expectations against the result of the exercise phase. 
// 4. Teardown: (optional) reset any conditions that were changed during test.
